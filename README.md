# stochastic_geometry_in_wireless_networks

Stochastic geometry is a common tool in analyzing wireless networks.
The file folder `matlab` is about how to experiment simulations using matlab, and `tutorial` is used for learning stochastic geometry.
This repository will continue updating.

Update: My paper "Interference and Coverage Analysis for Terahertz Networks with Indoor Blockage Effects and Line-of-Sight Access Point Association" accepted to IEEE Transcations on Wireless Communications.
